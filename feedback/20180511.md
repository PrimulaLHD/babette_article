MEE-18-03-185.R1 babette: BEAUti 2, BEAST2 and Tracer for R

Dear Dr Richèl Bilderbeek,

It is a pleasure to accept your manuscript entitled "babette: BEAUti 2, BEAST2 and Tracer for R" in its current form (but see below for the AE's final remarks) for publication in Methods in Ecology and Evolution.

Please note that although the manuscript is accepted the files will now be checked to ensure that everything is ready for publication, and you may be contacted if final versions of files for publication are required. Please also note that the AE has a few comments that you might like to consider.

Your article cannot be published until you have signed the appropriate license agreement. Within the next few days you will receive an email from Wiley’s Author Services system which will ask you to log in and will present you with the appropriate licence for completion.

We encourage authors to provide a second abstract in their native language or the language relevant to the country in which the research was conducted. The second abstract will be published with the online version of the article and will not be included in the PDF. Please note that second abstracts will not be copyedited and will be published as provided by the authors. Authors who wish to take advantage of this option should provide the second abstract in the main document below the English language version.

Finally, we would like to invite you to submit images to could be suitable for our front cover.

Thank you for your fine contribution. On behalf of all Editors of Methods in Ecology and Evolution, I look forward to your continued contributions to the Journal.

Dear Dr Richèl Bilderbeek,

I'ld like to thank you and Dr. Rampal Etienne for carefully addressing all issues raised by the Reviewers as well as myself. I have the following few final comments on the revised manuscript myself; however, I consider addressing these comments as optional:
- On lines 44-46 you describe that the one might want to explore a large number of trees when doing simulations. While I agree with this, it could be worthwile to also emphasize the usefulness of babette for analyzing phylogenies in sliding windows across a full-genome alignment, which is becoming increasingly popular (Gante et al. 2016, Mol Ecol, "Genomics of speciation and introgression in Princess cichlid fishes from Lake Tanganyika" and Figueiro et al. 2017, Sci Adv, "Genome-wide signatures of complex introgression and adaptive evolution in the big cats" are two examples of many).
- On line 55-56, you write that "Tracer's purpose is to analyze the parameters generated from a BEAST2 run". This is one of the capabilities, but describing it as Tracer's purpose goes a bit too far, particularly since Tracer is primarily developed by Andrew Rambaut, who develops BEAST1 and contributes only little to BEAST2.
- On line 127, the parentheses around the citation of Van Els & Norambuena should be removed.

Best regards,
Michael Matschiner
