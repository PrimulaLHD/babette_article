Dear Dr Richèl Bilderbeek,

I'ld like to thank you and Dr. Rampal Etienne for carefully addressing all issues raised by the Reviewers as well as myself. I have the following few final comments on the revised manuscript myself; however, I consider addressing these comments as optional:
- On lines 44-46 you describe that the one might want to explore a large number of trees when doing simulations. While I agree with this, it could be worthwile to also emphasize the usefulness of babette for analyzing phylogenies in sliding windows across a full-genome alignment, which is becoming increasingly popular (Gante et al. 2016, Mol Ecol, "Genomics of speciation and introgression in Princess cichlid fishes from Lake Tanganyika" and Figueiro et al. 2017, Sci Adv, "Genome-wide signatures of complex introgression and adaptive evolution in the big cats" are two examples of many).
- On line 55-56, you write that "Tracer's purpose is to analyze the parameters generated from a BEAST2 run". This is one of the capabilities, but describing it as Tracer's purpose goes a bit too far, particularly since Tracer is primarily developed by Andrew Rambaut, who develops BEAST1 and contributes only little to BEAST2.
- On line 127, the parentheses around the citation of Van Els & Norambuena should be removed.

Best regards,
Michael Matschiner
