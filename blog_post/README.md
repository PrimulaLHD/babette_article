`babette` is an R package to work with the popular phylogenetic tool BEAST2.
BEAST2 uses one or more alignments and a model setup to create a Bayesian
posterior of jointly estimated model parameters and phylogenies. `babette`
allows to call BEAST2 from an R script, allowing for an easier and 
more reproducible exploration of models and/or alignments 
than the user-friendly graphical user interface programs that BEAST2 provides.

For people new to phylogentic analyses, the video '[babette demo](https://youtu.be/84Qw07FyijY)'
demonstrates the package.

For those that already know BEAST2 and its helpers BEAUti 2 and Tracer, the
video '[babette comparison](https://youtu.be/nA-0-Fc95xY)' shows in what 
way `babette` gives exactly the sames results as these.

10 examples of BEAUti 2 model setups tranformed to `babette` function calls
