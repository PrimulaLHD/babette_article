> Overall it was a good and easy-to-follow read :) concise and to the point. 
> My remarks are really on minor things such as spelling, grammar or citations 
> (which in some cases I am not 100% sure about but preferred to point it out if it sounded weird). 
> Good job!
>
> Extra hint: The key point why people should use beautier is that it saves a huge time compared 
> to BEAUti when dealing with a lot of alignments. 
> Could you add a catchy sentence to the abstract that highlights this? 
> I think it would clarify at the very beginning of the article, 
> at least to beginners, why they should use the R version instead of the nice graphical interface of BEAUti.
>
> Also, for submission you may want to add line numbers to your manuscript. 
> Here's a TeX line of code to do it, if you don't already have it:

```
\usepackage[switch]{lineno}
```

> at the beginning of your TeX file.

> Hope it helps!

> I have read your ms. Please find it attached with some comments on it. 
> I am not sure what sort of journal you have in mind. 
> In my opinion, the current version of your ms is rather a manual (a very useful manual) 
> for the software you are presenting, and I am not sure if this is right. 
> The ms is extremely short which gives room for discussion for instance. 
> But again, it might depend on the journal you are aiming at. 
> In this light, my feedback could be more accurate if you send me a 
> example of an article (one of the journal you would prepare your ms for). 
>
> Congratulations for such a useful package Richel! it looks great

Note that I did not send an example article with it, so LHA could not know the article should be short.
