Dear Editor,

Please consider our manuscript "babette: BEAUti 2, BEAST2 and Tracer for R" for 
publication in Methods in Ecology & Evolution.

BEAST2 is one of the most widely used phylogenetic software tools.
One of the likely causes for its success is that it is
accompanied with some programs that have a user-friendly graphical 
user interface. However, when doing an intensive theoretical exploration,
with thousands of DNA alignments and/or model settings, 
a workflow of graphical user interfaces would be repetitive,
plain dumb or impossible. 

This manuscript describes `babette`, an R package that solves this problem.
There have been many partial solutions to work with BEAST2 from R.
Next to the partial solutions cited in this manuscript, there are
many more (uncitable) code snippets that automate part of the BEAST2 workflow.
`babette` unifies this scattered landscape of partial BEAST2 solutions,
as it is the first R package that offers a complete end-to-end workflow
to work with BEAST2 from R. This manuscript gives the reader an
idea of the scope and ease of use of `babette`, thanks to the examples supplied.

We believe that our manuscript helps increase the joy 
and thoroughness of future studies within phylogenetics 
and should therefore appeal to a wide audience. 
Hence, we feel that Methods in Ecology & Evolution is 
the ideal platform for our manuscript.

Kind regards,

Rich√®l J.C. Bilderbeek and Rampal S. Etienne
