Dear Editor,

Please consider our manuscript “babette: BEAUti 2, BEAST2 and Tracer for R” for 
publication in Methods in Ecology & Evolution.

Ecological limits to diversification are currently widely studied, 
and hotly debated (see for instance two contrasting opinion papers 
published in a recent issue of the 
American Naturalist: Harmon & Harrison 2015, Rabosky & Hurlbert 2015, 
both cited in our manuscript). A few years ago two of the authors of 
the current submission co-developed a method to detect 
diversity-dependence in diversification from molecular phylogenies, 
and to estimate the parameters (speciation, extinction, carrying 
capacity) underlying these dynamics. This method has since been 
employed to argue for diversity-dependence in various clades. 
However, the reliability of these tests (i.e. whether they 
correctly infer diversity-dependent or diversity-independent 
diversification dynamics) and the accuracy of their inferences 
remain largely unknown. Here we conduct an extensive simulation 
study to address these issues. We find severe biases in 
parameter estimates, the direction of which differs depending 
on the conditioning applied to the likelihood procedure (i.e. 
on crown age, tree size, or both). For the most unbiased 
approach (dual conditioning), we find large uncertainty in parameter 
estimates. Furthermore, regarding model selection reliability we 
arrive at the important conclusion that standard model selection 
tools are inappropriate. On the basis of these results we 
recommend the use of a bootstrap approach that resolves this 
issue and simultaneously leads to an estimate of parameter 
uncertainty, illustrating this approach for the 
diversification of Dendroica warblers.

We believe that our manuscript has important 
consequences for many studies performing diversification 
analyses and should therefore appeal to a wide audience. 
Hence, we feel that Methods in Ecology & Evolution is 
the ideal platform for our manuscript.

Kind regards,

Richel Bilderbeek and Rampal S. Etienne
